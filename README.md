# KurumiBleTuner
Tuning meter plays sound through Midi over BLE for Renesas 16bit microcontroller board GR-KURUMI

## How to build

Files under source directory is a web compiler project source code. So the gr_common directory is something automatically generated by web compiler(something like RLduino source codes).
If you want to build this project, It's better to use your own gr_common directory. Copy src and gr_sketch.cpp from this repository to your web compiler project.

1. Zip source/src folder.
2. Go to [Gadget Renesas Web compiler page](http://update.renesas.com/gur/compiler.do?&languageCode=jp "Web Compiler")
3. Create project for GR-KURUMI sketch
4. upload zip file we created above
5. upload and overwrite gr_sketch.cpp
6. build your project!
